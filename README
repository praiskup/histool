Tool to manipulate history files
================================

Currently there is only one function implemented -- history file cleaning.
Program reads the _old_ bash-like history (from stdin) and constructs _new_ one
(on stdout).  It just reads the old file bottom-up way, remembering all (unique)
line occurrences and it only exports firstly seen lines.

This filtering method guarantees that searching through cleaned history (by
subsequent 'CTRL+R' hits) is not affected as all remaining lines are still in
correct time-creation order.

Usage: `$ histool < ~/.bash_history > ~/.bash_history_filtered`
