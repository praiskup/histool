Tool to manipulate history files
================================

Currently there is only one function implemented -- the history file cleaning.
Program reads the _old_ bash-like history file (from stdin) and constructs
a _new_ cleaned-from-duplicates one (on stdout).  It just goes through the list
of history file entries the bottom-up way, remembering only the lines (strings)
that are seen for the first time.  Then this (once again reversed) list is
printed on stdout.

This filtering method guarantees that the searching through the cleaned history
file (by subsequent 'CTRL+R' hits) is not affected â€” all the remaining lines are
still in correct time-creation order.

Usage: `$ histool < ~/.bash_history > ~/.bash_history_filtered`
